		<h3>Who built this?</h3>
		<p>
			The enketo open-source project is a joint effort by Enketo LLC and Modi Research Group at Columbia University. Enketo.org is a stand-alone application hosted by Aid Web Solutions primarily for the benefit of ODK Aggregate users. A separate version of enketo is available on <a href="http://formhub.org">formhub.org</a> and is fully integrated with formhub.
